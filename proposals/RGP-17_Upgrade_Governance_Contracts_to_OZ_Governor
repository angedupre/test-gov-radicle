If executed, this proposal will:
- Execute the upgrade from Radworksâ€™ current governance contracts (Compound Governor Alpha) to Open Zeppelin Governor with the assistance of the ScopeLift team.
- Adjust the voting delay from 1 block to 24 hrs
- Pay the ScopeLift team the remainder of their fee to execute the contracts ($10k worth of $RAD)
